##Texting App

####This is a simple texting app built with Rails and Twillio

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/apis-and-twilio) was meant to introduce us to using external APIs in our Rails programs.
